### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. It’s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

To integrate `SPIndicator` into your Xcode project using Xcode 12, specify it in `File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency...`:

```ogdl
https://github.com/ivanvorobei/SPIndicator
```

### CocoaPods:

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate `SPIndicator` into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'SPIndicator'
```

### Manually

If you prefer not to use any of dependency managers, you can integrate `SPIndicator` into your project manually. Put `Sources/SPIndicator` folder in your Xcode project. Make sure to enable `Copy items if needed` and `Create groups`.

## Quick Start

For best experience, I recommend presenting indicator by calling the class functions `SPIndicator`. These functions are updated regularly and show the indicator as Apple way: 

```swift
SPIndicator.present(title: "Error", message: "Try Again", preset: .error)
```

For using a custom image:

```swift 
let image = UIImage.init(systemName: "sun.min.fill")!.withTintColor(.systemYellow, renderingMode: .alwaysOriginal)
SPIndicator.present(title: "Custom Image", message: "With tint color", preset: .custom(image)))
```

For showing a simple text message:

```swift 
SPIndicator.present(title: "Error", haptic: .error)
```
You can provide message optional too.

## Usage

### Duration

For change duration of present time, create indicator view and call `present` method with custom duration:

```swift
let indicatorView = SPIndicatorView(title: "Complete", preset: .done)
indicatorView.present(duration: 3)
```

### Layout

For customise layout and margins, use `layout` property. You can manage margins for each side, icon size and space between image and titles:

```swift
indicatorView.layout.iconSize = .init(width: 24, height: 24)
indicatorView.layout.margins.top = 12
```

### Dismiss by Drag

By default allow drag indicator for hide. While indicator is dragging, dismiss not work. This can be disabled:

```swift
indicatorView.dismissByDrag = false
```

### Haptic

For manage haptic, you shoud pass it in present method:

```swift
indicatorView.present(duration: 1.5, haptic: .success, completion: nil)
```

You can remove duration and completion, its have default values.

### Present Side

If you need present from special side, use this: 

```swift
SPIndicator.present(title: "Error", message: "Try Again", preset: .error, from: .bottom)

// or with custom view

indicatorView.presentSide = .bottom
```
In last cases indicator will appear from bottom and attached to bottom.
